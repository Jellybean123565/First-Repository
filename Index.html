    <h3>How to Skate:</h3>
    <h4
 style="color:rgba(350,99,55,2)">Basics</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Make sure your skates are upright when you stand in them.</li>
    <li>When you get on the ice, (if you just started skating) hold the railing and start walking forward on the ice.</li>
      <li>You will soon get the sensation that walking on ice is a pretty hard. </li>
    <li>Turn one of your skates (your dominant foot) out, and make an L shape with your feet.</li>
      <li>Push back with the foot that is not pointing forward. You should be moving forward, gliding.</li>
    <li>You should keep going with this if you don’t want to fall.</li>
    <li>You should switch feet everytime. This process will soon get ea///sier, and you will be able to skate!</li></ol>
  <h3>Good Luck!</h3>
